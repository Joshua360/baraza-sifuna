        <p>Manure application should be a sustainable agricultural practice. It is a very beneficial way to recycle manure nutrients within an agricultural system. Some of the benefits of manure application include, improved soil tilth, structure, aeration, and water holding capacity. Using manure as opposed to inorganic fertilizers minimizes the risk of polluting surface water and ground water. These are some of the things that we teach and demonstrate to farmers during the manure application demonstrations.  </p>
