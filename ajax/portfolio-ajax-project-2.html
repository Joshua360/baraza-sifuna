      <p>The Moringa Herb has attracted massive scientific research interests over the last decade. Research tells us of the great, yet under-utilized potential lying in the exploitation of the Moringa trees. Some of the benefits and multipurpose uses associated with the Moringa plant include, human consumption, water purification, production of oil and biofuel, medicinal uses, production of livestock feed and domestic cleaning agents among others. The MHD Program being implemented in the Mukuranga area of South Dar-es-salaam, focuses on introducing the Moringa plant in the area and tapping on ideal land to sustainably produce Moringa for commercial purposes. Furthermore, the program creates awareness around the nutritional value and market potential of the Moringa products to farmers and households. </p>
